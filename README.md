# ZoMID
A rust based implementation of project zomboid mod id collection using gtk bindings in the form of [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/)
now ready for first release!

I am still relatively new to these things such as knowing if there is some way to package the library files needed within the program binary in windows.
For other platforms, I havent been able to test on machines that didnt have devkits on them.

I plan to run tests in a vm soon enough. For now though the program binary is available for Windows, Mac and Linux(Developed and Tested on Arch, unsure how other distros may handle things, give it a shot and lmk!).

## DLL's for GTK are included are with the .exe, also I do not have money for signing exe's so Windows will tell you the program is a virus, it is not!
